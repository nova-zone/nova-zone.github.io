## We have a new blog!

Using Jekyll, Git, Prose, CloudFlare DNS, and a wee bit of magic, I made us this self-generating website. It creates pages from Markdown files and serves these webpages from the newly registered [nova-zone.com](http://nova-zone.com) domain.

### Developer Use

The Nova Zone devteam can use the new site by [contacting me](mailto:jamescallumyoung+nova-zone@gmail.com) and asking for their account to be added to the contributor list on the git repo. Then simply login to the [Nova Zone Blog Editor](http://prose.nova-zone.com).
